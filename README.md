Welcome! :smile:

My name is Hanan, and I am a Data Scientist. This repository consists of some of many projects that I have worked on, in the field of machine learning and natural language processing, these are listed below.

- Automated Hyper parameter optimization for an artifical neural network using a combination of random and bayesian optimization search.
- Transfer learning in TCAD enabled machine learning.
- Low Context Word Prediction (LCWP) using fine tuned BERT.
- N-gram model sentence prediction.
