The NFL Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee announced the following policy changes
on March 28:
All teams are required to have a woman or minority offensive assistant on staff for the 2022
season.
The Rooney Rule has been expanded to include women, regardless of their racial or ethnic
background.
The following rule changes were approved at the NFL Owner's Meeting on March 28:[106]
● In the postseason only, both teams are assured of one possession in overtime, even
if the first team with possession scores a touchdown. This change was made in
response to several recent playoff games in which the first team to possess the ball
in overtime scored a touchdown and the other team did not have a chance to
respond.
● Made permanent a 2021 experimental rule change to limit the receiving team on
kickoffs to no more than nine players in the "set-up zone" (the area between 10 and
25 yards from the kickoff spot).
● The following changes to roster management were made on May 25
● Players on injured reserve (IR) are eligible to return to the roster after missing four
games. This is up from the temporary three-game requirement in place during 2020
and 2021 to account for the impact of COVID-19 on rosters, but down from the eight
games required prior to 2020.
● Teams can allow up to eight players to return from IR to the active roster per season.
This limit was previously two players prior to 2020, but the limit was temporarily
removed for 2020 and 2021. A player may return from injured reserve multiple times
in a single season, but each return counts against the team's allotment of eight.
● Practice squads will remain at 16 players. The temporary increase from 12 to 16
players originally introduced in 2020 was made permanent.
● Teams may continue to elevate up to two players from the practice squad to the
game-day roster for each game. A practice squad player may be elevated up to three
times per season before the team is required to sign him to the active roster (up from
the previous limit of two games).
The following change to the concussion protocol was made on October 8, following Tua
Tagovailoa's injury in week 3 added the diagnosis of ataxia to the mandatory "no-go"
symptoms that determine whether or not a player re-enters a game.
The following enhancement and updates to diversity, equity and inclusion efforts was
announced at the NFL Fall League Meeting on October 18
