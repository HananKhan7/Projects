# Transfer learning in TCAD enabled machine learning

## Introduction
Transfer learning stands for utilizing feature representations from a pre-trained model so that we do not have to train a new model from scratch, and it comes in handy when we do not have a huge data set. 

## Implementation
### Base model
- explaining how to get base model (Highly optimized model)

### Weight vectors
- explaining mathematical rep, how hidden layer node values/ weight vectors are achieved.

### Setting up features/inputs
- explaining adding & removing features.

### Training process
#### Freezing weights
- to retain transfered info of features.

#### Un-freezing weights
- finetuning
